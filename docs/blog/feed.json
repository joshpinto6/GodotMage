They recently removed the last trace of a real videogame from their website banner video, now featuring their XR, IoT, clearly showing their priority for more profitable industries.</p><div class=\"theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9\"><div class=\"admonitionHeading_tbUL\"><span class=\"admonitionIcon_kALy\"><svg viewBox=\"0 0 14 16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z\"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class=\"admonitionContent_S0QG\"><p>Following the backlash from users pointing out website changes, Unity updated its website to feature game development more centrally. At first, this seems like a good thing, but considering they didn't make any announcements regarding this change or how their company is planning to move forward, this just comes across as just a form of damage control.</p></div></div><p>However, this is nothing new. If you don't know, Unity is a publically traded company. This means that they are <strong>legally obligated to make any business </strong>decision that <strong>benefits</strong> their shareholders<strong>.</strong> AKA: To make as much money as possible, using any means necessary. Regardless of how it affects their community.</p><p>Unlike Unity, Godot has no corporate management teams in big buildings deciding mergers. Godot is free and open source. This means that the community builds the software. We, the community, help to build the platform. Some big company can't just come and mess things up.</p><p>Now, this article isn't supposed to be a rant about Unity, instead, it was meant to reflect on the highlights of Godot, as an emerging platform choice for game developers.</p>",
