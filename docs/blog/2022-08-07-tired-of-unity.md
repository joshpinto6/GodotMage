If you haven't already heard the news: [Unity has merged with the advertising company IronSource.](https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-ironsource) This comes in a recent series of moves designed at "broadening their company", and apparently moving away from game development. 

For example, they recently laid off the team behind Gigaya, an in-house example game created by Unity to highlight the features of their **"game"** engine. 

I put the word **game** in bold because someone looking at their website would have a hard time figuring out that Unity is a game engine. They recently removed the last trace of a real videogame from their website banner video, now featuring their XR, IoT, clearly showing their priority for more profitable industries.

Following the backlash from users pointing out website changes, Unity updated their website to feature game development more prominantly. However, they didn't make any announcements regarding devs' griveances, so this just comes across as just a form of damage control.

However, this is nothing new. If you don't know, Unity is a publically traded company. This means that they are **legally obligated to make any business decision that benefit their shareholders.** AKA: To make as much money as possible, using any means necessary. Regardless of how it affects their community.

Unlike Unity, Godot has no corporate management teams in big buildings deciding mergers. Godot is free and open source. This means that the community builds the software. Us, the community, help to build the platform. Some big company can't just come and mess things up.

Now, this article isn't supposed to be a rant about Unity, instead it was meant to reflect on the highlights of Godot, as an emerging platform choice for game developers.
