By now, you've probably chosen to make your game in Godot. Congratulations! Godot is a great, developing game engine, with endless possibilities. But where do you start?

:::info 
🎉 Godot 3.5 comes with new features to the built-in Git plugin, such as diff view, as well as push, pull, and fetch operations. [Read the news here!](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-3-5-cant-stop-wont-stop) 

This tutorial contains instructions on how to set up and use this plugin.

## What is Git and why should I use it?
You may think: "My game isn't big enough for a version control system", or that "Git sounds too complicated for me to set up". Both of these are frequent reactions, but not using a VCS will make your job as a developer harder.

You see, version control systems are there to make your life simpler. Waiting until your product is bigger, or thinking it sounds too complicated will result in hundreds of headaches for you as a developer. 

>I would recommend investing just a little bit of time now adding Git to your game to make your life much more simple in the future.

This tutorial is about why you should use a version control system like Git, and how you can add it to your Godot games. First of all, it's important to know what Git is, what a version control system is, and why it is important.

A Version Control System (or VCS) is important in virtually any software development project, including your Godot games! But what does a VCS do? A Version Control system allows you to manage (you guessed it!) versions of your software! 

> Git is one of the most popular version control systems, and arguably the easiest to integrate with Godot. Because of its usage in software, it's a really useful skill to have.

### What is a "Remote Repository"?
You may be wondering what the difference between Git and Github is. 

Git and Github are not the same: It's important to know that Github, which is owned by Microsoft, is just one of MANY Git remote repository services out there, including:
- GitLab
- Bitbucket
- SourceForge
- Github (obviously)

Github is a great remote repository host because it gives you **unlimited private and public repositories, for free with unlimited collaborators** This tutorial will teach you how to integrate Github with Godot.

### Why use a remote repository?

In the previous section, I mentioned that Github is a remote repository. **But what does that mean?** Git is a free and open version control system software that you install and initialize locally on your computer with which you can create repositories or storage containers for your code. 

A remote repository is a cloud backup of this local repository. Remote repositories allow you to collaborate with others, with everyone pushing and pulling to the same **main** codebase. Additionally, if Godot crashes, your files are corrupted, or a change you make introduces a huge bug, you can roll back your changes to a working version. Like magic! You can also allow others to download, playtest, and contribute to your project, they can clone your remote repository to their local machines!

:::note
**Right now, I bet this sounds very complicated**, but I can assure you that it's not. Once you start using Git (in the next section), you'll see how simple it is!

## Installing Git (on your device)
The best way to understand Git is to install it. It only takes a few minutes to install. But how do we do that? The following steps will show you how to install Git on your device. Then w

### Installation Steps

First, choose the installation steps for your OS below:

  Git can be installed on Linux via a binary installer using the package manager tool that comes with your distribution. If you’re on a Debian-based distribution, such as Ubuntu, try apt:

  ```sh
  $ sudo apt install git-all
  ```

   If you're installing Git on a Fedora or related RPM-based distribution (such as RHEL or CentOS), use dnf:

  ```sh
  $ sudo dnf install git-all
  ```

  🎉 Congratulations! Git is installed! Now move on to [How does Git work?](#how-does-git-work)

## How does Git work?
Git Repositories can contain branches, which are like versions of your codebase. You can create branches
