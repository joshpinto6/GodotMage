# GodotMage Tutorial Project Sources
GodotMage provides the project sources for all of our tutorials and snippets (where applicable), for free, and can be downloaded from the Releases tab of the Github repository, or from the `sources` directory (this directory), which contains the tutorial sources for all of our tutorials.

The releases are sorted by tutorial versions and name, and when applicable will contain the episode in a tutorial or video series. 

**Tutorial releases:** usually contain a `starter` and `complete` zip archives. The `starter` folder contains the godot project starter code, with all the assets and setup (Input mappings, etc.) preconfigured for you. The `complete` folder contains the complete source code of the godot project, when all steps are followed correctly. This is helpful in case you made mistakes along the way and want to compare your files with the finished project, or in case you just want to take the end files.

**Snippet releases:** in the case of shaders, or other small additions to projects, will conatin a `snippet` folder with the applicable snippet code/files, and (sometimes) a `demo` zip archive containing a demo scene or project showing off this snippet.

Each release's description will usually contain the version of Godot that the source code has been tested with, as well as additional information about the releases, in case you forget any of the information here ðŸ˜‰.

Tutorial sources which can found in the `sources/` directory, organized into subfolders by tutorial ID and episode, contain a README with most of the same information as found in the release page for the source code. Additionally, each release links to the source found in the `sources/` directory, and each project README file found in this directory's subfolders contains a link to the corresponding release.

In the case in which you follow our Youtube video tutorials, the source code link will be mentioned at the end of the video, as a link to a release page, and will also be found in the video description. You can also access the text-version of each tutorial from the video description.
